## Solution:
Here is the initial information I have after searching for the details in the photo:

Starting with the military airplane was not a good idea; I only found one website with its past locations, but none matched the airport in the photo:

I went back to Google Lens and selected different search areas. I will prioritize checking the results with images of the forest edge outside the airport:

Checking on Google Maps, I see a long building in the corner of the airport near the forest, which looks quite similar to the one in the photo:

<br>Using Google Street View, I'm quite sure I've found the right place.
